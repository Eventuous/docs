Eventuous connectors allow subscribing to events from EventStoreDB (source) and produce derived events to another system (sink). Some sinks also support reduce-like operations that work as [projections]({{< ref "rm-concept" >}}).

The documentation for connectors is currently in progress. You can find some basic information in the connectors [repository](https://github.com/Eventuous/connectors).
