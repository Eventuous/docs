Subscribing to all events in the store is extremely valuable. This way, you can build comprehensive read models, which consolidate information from multiple aggregates. You can also use such a subscription for integration purposes, to convert and publish integration events.

## All stream subscription service

The `AllStreamSubscriptionService` class inherits from the [subscription service]({{< ref "sub-service" >}}).

Although the `AllStreamSubscriptionService` class is not abstract, we do not recommend using it directly. You need to create your own class, which inherits from `AllStreamSubscriptionService`. This way, you can specify, which event handlers that specific subscription service will serve.
